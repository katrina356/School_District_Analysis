# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The primary purpose of this analysis is to analyze the impact of academic dishonesty on a given data set.  During this module we performed an initial analysis on 15 schools to compare their performance and understand what may contribute to a school being a "high" performer.  Additional information came to light that indicated their may be a case of academic dishonesty in one of the schools.  As such we performed a secondary analysis removing the data that was in question (the math and reading scores of 9th graders in Thomas high school).  The below summarizes the impact on the results by removing this data

## Results

### The Original Data Set:
Overall medium size schools were the top performers regardless of the spending ranges per students.  There is one large school in the top 5 performers, Wilson High School.  The top performing schools all had over 90% of the students with passing grades in both math and reading while the bottom performing schools dropped drastically to on 50% with passing both reading and math.  The biggest variance in the % of passing is due to Math.  In the top performing schools the percentage of students passing math was in the 90% range while the bottom performing schools were significantly different at 66% (over 20% variance

There appears to be a negative correlation between the spending ranges per student and the average % of students passing for reading, math and both, with a more pronounced impact on math

Overall charter schools performed better than district schools.
